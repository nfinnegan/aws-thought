# aws-thought

Worked on the following in this module

- Configure IAM user permissions to connect various AWS services.

- Store and retrieve static assets using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).

- Connect an existing application to a DynamoDB database.

- Configure a Linux server to deploy the application to an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance.

Over the course of the module:

- Studied the as-a-Service model that cloud providers apply to web services so that consumers have different levels of control according to their needs.

- Rationalized the business advantages of leveraging the infrastructure of cloud providers vs. creating on-premises solutions.

- Implemented a database service that's scalable at high performance, called DynamoDB, to organize queries.

- Used an S3 bucket for large static assets and integrated the URL into DynamoDB.

- Deployed the application to an EC2 instance.
